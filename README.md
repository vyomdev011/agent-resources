## Quick Start

No installation needed. Just run:

```bash
uvx agr add kasperjunge/hello-world
```

**That's it.** The skill is now available in Claude Code. The resource type (skill, command, agent, or bundle) is auto-detected.

Or install permanently:

```bash
pip install agr
agr add kasperjunge/hello-world
```

---

## Install Any Resource

```bash
agr add <username>/<name>                # Auto-detects resource type
agr add <username>/<name> --type skill   # Explicit type (if needed)
agr add <username>/<repo>/<name>         # From a custom repository
```

Resources install to organized namespaced paths:

```
.claude/
└── skills/
    └── kasperjunge/           # Organized by username
        └── hello-world/
```

This prevents naming conflicts and keeps your resources organized.

### Install a Bundle

Install multiple resources at once:

```bash
agr add kasperjunge/anthropic
```

---

## Dependency Tracking

**New in v0.4.0:** Track your project's resources with `agr.toml`.

### The agr.toml File

When you add resources, agr automatically tracks them in `agr.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
"kasperjunge/hello-world" = {}
"madsnorgaard/drupal-expert" = { type = "skill" }
"acme/tools/review" = { type = "command" }
```

This file is lightweight, human-readable, and perfect for version control.

### Sync Your Resources

Set up a new machine or share your project? One command installs everything:

```bash
agr sync
```

This reads `agr.toml` and installs any missing resources.

### Keep Things Tidy

Remove resources that aren't in your `agr.toml`:

```bash
agr sync --prune
```

### Workflow

```bash
# Add resources (automatically tracked in agr.toml)
agr add kasperjunge/hello-world
agr add madsnorgaard/drupal-expert

# Commit agr.toml to version control
git add agr.toml && git commit -m "Add agent dependencies"

# On another machine, sync everything
agr sync
```

---

## Run Without Installing (agrx)

Try a skill or command without permanent installation:

```bash
agrx kasperjunge/hello-world              # Auto-detects and runs
agrx kasperjunge/hello-world "my prompt"  # Run with a prompt
agrx kasperjunge/hello-world -i           # Interactive mode
```

The resource is downloaded, executed, and cleaned up automatically.

---

## Create Your Own Library

Create your personal agent-resources library:

```bash
agr init repo --github
```

**Done.** You now have a GitHub repo that anyone can install from.

> Requires [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). Run without `--github` to set up manually.

### What You Get

- A ready-to-use `agent-resources` repo on your GitHub
- Example skill, command, and agent to learn from
- Instant shareability:

```bash
agr add <your-username>/hello-world
```

### Add Your Own Resources

Edit the files in your repo:

```
your-username/agent-resources/
└── .claude/
    ├── skills/          # Skill folders with SKILL.md
    ├── commands/        # Slash command .md files
    └── agents/          # Sub-agent .md files
```

Push to GitHub.
