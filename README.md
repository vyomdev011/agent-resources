## Try It Now

No installation needed. Just run:

```bash
uvx agr add skill kasperjunge/hello-world
```

**That's it.** The skill is now available in Claude Code.

Or install permanently:

```bash
pip install agr
agr add skill kasperjunge/hello-world
```

---

## Install Any Resource

```bash
agr add skill <username>/<skill-name>       # Skills
agr add command <username>/<command-name>   # Slash commands
agr add agent <username>/<agent-name>       # subagents
```

### Default Repository Convention

If you name your repo `agent-resources`, users only need to specify your username and resource name:

```bash
# Installs from github.com/kasperjunge/agent-resources
agr add skill kasperjunge/hello-world
```

### Install From Any Repository

You can install from any GitHub repository that has the `.claude/` structure. Just use the three-part format:

```bash
# Installs from github.com/username/custom-repo
agr add skill username/custom-repo/my-skill
```

### Install a Bundle

Install multiple resources at once with bundles:

```bash
agr add bundle kasperjunge/anthropic
```

This installs all skills, commands, and agents from the bundle in one command.

---

## Create Your Own Library

Create your personal agent-resources library:

```bash
agr init repo --github
```

**Done.** You now have a GitHub repo that anyone can install from.

> Requires [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). Run without `--github` to set up manually.

### What You Get

- A ready-to-use `agent-resources` repo on your GitHub
- Example skill, command, and agent to learn from
- Instant shareability:

```bash
agr add skill <your-username>/hello-world
```

### Add Your Own Resources

Edit the files in your repo:

```
your-username/agent-resources/
└── .claude/
    ├── skills/          # Skill folders with SKILL.md
    ├── commands/        # Slash command .md files
    └── agents/          # Sub-agent .md files
```

Push to GitHub.
