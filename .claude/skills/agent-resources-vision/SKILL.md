# Agent Resources - Project Vision

This document defines the ideal outcomes we're building toward. Use it to guide development decisions and maintain alignment with the project's purpose.

## For Individual Users

**Build Your Personal Agent Toolkit**
- Curate a personal collection of your best skills, commands, and agents in your own GitHub repo
- Your toolkit travels with you across machines, projects, and jobs
- Iterate and refine your resources over time as you discover what works
- Version control your AI workflow improvements

**Instant Capability Extension**
- Add new capabilities to Claude Code with a single command
- No manual downloading, copying, or configuration
- Zero installation friction via `uvx` - just run and go
- Works immediately without restarting or setup steps

**Leverage Community Knowledge**
- Access a growing ecosystem of resources built by others
- Skip the learning curve by using battle-tested configurations
- Find domain-specific setups (security, data science, DevOps, etc.)
- Learn from how others structure effective prompts and workflows

## For the Community

**Frictionless Sharing**
- Share resources as easily as sharing a link: "try `uvx skill-add yourname/cool-skill`"
- Drop recommendations in Slack, Discord, Twitter, or READMEs
- No publishing step, no registry approval - push to GitHub and it's available

**Social Discovery**
- GitHub username IS your namespace - identity-linked sharing
- Follow interesting developers to see what resources they create
- Star and fork repos to track and remix useful collections
- The existing GitHub social graph becomes the discovery mechanism

**Network Effects**
- The more people share, the more valuable the ecosystem becomes
- Popular resources get visibility through GitHub's existing mechanisms
- Specialization emerges - people become known for specific domains
- Remixing and building on others' work accelerates innovation

**Low Barrier to Contribution**
- Anyone with a GitHub account can be a creator
- No infrastructure to maintain - GitHub handles hosting and distribution
- Start by sharing one useful skill; grow from there
- Democratizes access to high-quality AI workflows

---

## The Big Picture

**From Tool to Platform**
- Transforms Claude Code from a personal tool into a community-extensible platform
- Creates a marketplace effect without the marketplace overhead
- Enables specialization and division of labor in AI workflow development

**Multiplied Productivity**
- Individual improvements benefit everyone who uses them
- Standing on the shoulders of the community's collective experimentation
- Time invested in creating good resources pays dividends across the ecosystem

**Dotfiles for the AI Era**
- Like dotfiles repos, but for AI agent configurations
- Personal, shareable, forkable, remixable
- A new primitive for how developers customize and share their AI-augmented workflows

## Decision-Making Guide

When uncertain about a feature or design choice, ask:

1. **Does it reduce friction?** - Fewer steps to share/install = better
2. **Does it leverage existing infrastructure?** - GitHub-native > custom registry
3. **Does it enable the social layer?** - Personal identity + sharing = network effects
4. **Does it serve both user segments?** - Individual AND community value
5. **Is it simple enough to just work?** - `uvx` one-liner is the gold standard
