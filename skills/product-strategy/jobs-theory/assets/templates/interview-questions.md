## The Script

### Opening (2 min)

> Thanks so much for taking the time. I'm trying to understand how people end up using [PRODUCT] - not to sell you anything, just to learn. I'd love to hear the story of how you found us.
>
> There are no right or wrong answers. I'm just curious about your experience.

---

### Phase 1: First Thought (5-7 min)

> Let's go back to before you had [PRODUCT].
>
> **When did you first realize you might need something like this?**

Listen, then probe:
- "What was happening at that moment?"
- "Where were you? What were you doing?"
- "Was there a specific event, or was it gradual?"
- "How did that make you feel?"

---

### Phase 2: Passive Looking (3-5 min)

> **After that first thought, what did you do?**

Listen, then probe:
- "Did you notice any solutions without actively looking?"
- "Did anyone mention anything to you?"
- "How long were you in this 'not really doing anything about it' phase?"

---

### Phase 3: Active Looking (5-7 min)

> **When did you start seriously looking for a solution?**

Listen, then probe:
- "What made you shift from thinking about it to actually searching?"
- "What did you search for? What sites did you visit?"
- "What were your must-haves?"
- "What other options did you consider?"
- "How did you compare them?"

---

### Phase 4: Deciding (5-7 min)

> **How did you make your final decision?**

Listen, then probe:
- "What made you choose [PRODUCT] over the alternatives?"
- "Was there anything that almost stopped you?"
- "Did you talk to anyone about it? Who?"
- "What did you tell yourself to justify the choice?"

---

### Phase 5: First Use (5-7 min)

> **What was it like the first time you used [PRODUCT]?**

Listen, then probe:
- "Walk me through that first day/week"
- "What was the first thing you did with it?"
- "How long until you felt like you 'got it'?"
- "What surprised you - good or bad?"

---

### Phase 6: Ongoing (5 min)

> **How's it going now?**

Listen, then probe:
- "Is it solving the problem you originally had?"
- "What would you do if it disappeared tomorrow?"
- "Have you told anyone else about it?"
- "What's still frustrating?"

---

### Closing (2 min)

> This has been really helpful.
>
> **Is there anything else about your experience that I should know?**

Then:
> Thank you so much. This helps me understand how people use [PRODUCT] in the real world.
