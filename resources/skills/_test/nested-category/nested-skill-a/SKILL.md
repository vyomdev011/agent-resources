# Nested Skill A

A test skill nested within a category namespace to test 2-level nesting and namespace detection.

## Usage

This skill tests that skills within nested directories are discovered correctly and that namespaces are properly detected.

## Instructions

When this skill is invoked:
1. Confirm you are executing nested-skill-a from the nested-category namespace
2. Report the full flattened name (should include nested-category in the path)
3. Verify namespace detection is working correctly
