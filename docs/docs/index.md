# Agent Resources

**The package manager and index for AI agents.**

```bash
pip install agr
agr install kasperjunge/code-reviewer
```

## The Vision

What would Python be without PyPI? JavaScript without npm?

Today's AI agents are powerful in isolation, but the ecosystem is fragmented. Sharing agent resources means copying files, hoping they work, and staying locked to one platform.

**Agent Resources** fixes this.

One package manager. Every major tool—Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode. Skills, commands, subagents, and every agentic primitive that makes agents powerful.

### What We're Building

- **Universal** — Write once, run everywhere
- **Simple** — `agr install` and you're done
- **Versioned** — Pin, update, roll back
- **Composable** — Resources can depend on other resources
- **Open** — Install from GitHub or the central registry
- **Discoverable** — Find and share community resources

### Why It Matters

The barrier between creating something useful and sharing it with the world should be zero.

Create a resource. Push to GitHub. Anyone can install it instantly.

This is how ecosystems grow. This is Agent Resources.
